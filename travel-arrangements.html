    <h1>Travel arrangements, and planning</h1>
    <p>Where are we you ask? Well we are located about 10-15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes by foot from the airport. We strongly advise taking a taxi, as its rough out there. We would love for you to look into our wonderful travel packages. We offer plenty of lodging sharing deals. Especially for families of 15.
    </p>

    <h1>Things to consider, and lookout for!</h1>
    <p>We have plenty of theft around here, so be AWARE. We also have a serious situation regarding Raccoons.</p>
